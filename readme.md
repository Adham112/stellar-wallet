# Stellar Wallet

Stores encrypted data. The wallet server can't decrypt the data. Used by https://github.com/stellar/stellar-client to save the user's secret keys. 



## Getting Started

1. Get yourself a db: `gulp db:setup`
1. Get yourself a running server: `stex www --watch`
1. Start making requests against port 3000 (by default)

## Connect directly to mysql

`stex db-console`
